        My name is Rachael Gladwin. I live in Denver with my son Nathan and my three dogs. 
        I have an 8 year old pitbull and two huskie pups under 1 year old. 
        We love summer sports and activities as we're huge swimmers, but we take any opportunity we can toget outdoors and have fun.
        <br>
        <br>
        Professionally I spent many years in learning and development, managing new projects and programs.
        I am transitioning to the world of development as I start my career in coding. I look forward to being an app developer in the near future.
